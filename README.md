# Introduction
Current research at the intersection of [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence) and eye disease diagnosis utilizes medical images from [Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1531864/), [Fundus Photography (FP)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fundus-photography) and [slit-lamps](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/treatments/what-is-slit-lamp) as input into [Deep Learning (DL)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/) models. In cases were such models make it into production in the form of a software application, their use is limited to mainly [ophthalmologists](https://www.rcophth.ac.uk/about/what-is-ophthalmology/what-is-an-ophthalmologist/) and other medical professionals who have access to medical imaging equipment that can take such images. This does not take into account regions of the world where such equipment is either scarce or not available.

To tackle this problem, this repository diverges from current research and investigates the potential use of non-medical images such as those taken by smartphones as input into a DL model capable of eye disease diagnosis. Smartphones are an abundant resource - no matter how remote an area is, you are more likely to find a smartphone capable of taking basic images than finding scientific equipment for taking OCT or FP images or even an ophthalmologists. Due to the lack of abundant annotated data, the use of non-medical images in eye disease classification is formulated as a [Few-Shot-Learning (FSL)](https://neptune.ai/blog/understanding-few-shot-learning-in-computer-vision) classification problem and solved using [Prototypical Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/few-shot-learning-with-prototypical-networks-87949de03ccd).
